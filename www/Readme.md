<h1>ionic counter</h1>

<p>This is the read me for my ionic counter which is a very basic counter for callories</p>
<br>
<p>The app has a simple interface by which the user only has to put in the nameof the food they want to track callories of and then uses the buttons to count up the callories they can then add the food to a list which stores the food name and the food callories this works for a meal as well</p>
